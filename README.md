# Small mobile game

## TargetSum

I'm bringing my GitHub activity back to life after a long while working only behind the curtain.
TargetSum is a small game app built with react native for the sake of implementing it's fundamentals and also to acquire some personal hands-on experience. Since this is the only purpose I built it for, I decided to keep syntax old school. Layout has not been a priority to me in this case either.

### How it works

You have 10 seconds to reach the target number on top by summing as many random numbers as needed.

#### If you mean to run it

Mac scenario --> You will need to run yarn install and then yarn ios or yarn android once opened proper simulator/emulator.
Windows scenario --> It should be enough running npm install and then npm start (truth is: this has not been checked).
